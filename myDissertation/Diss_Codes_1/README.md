Code for the work 
"Examining Temporal Issues in EEG-based BCI: Detecting imagined words in continuous EEG signals"

- Datasets contain the preprocessed data collected from kaggle' https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tonahdztoro/toward-asynchronous 'as the real time data was insufficient to train.
- Download the required Datasets folder containing Online and real data from -->  https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1heMlFK8lZ9fpNG1KbXtmPzm1Y12Olgj2?usp=sharing

- main.py contains the main body of the code and functions.py contain all the necessary functions used for the succcessful completion. plots.py are used to plot the box plots to analyse the results.

- The source code was adapted from the paper, "Toward asynchronous EEG-based BCI: Detecting imagined words segments in continuous EEG signals" . The link for the paper is " https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809420304626 "
