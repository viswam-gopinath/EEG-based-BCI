-Here are the functions needed for the extraction of the instances used in the python
codes (Diss_Codes_1), for the DS2. This can be generalised to any dataset that has the same structure.

- The main code is run in the Main_DS2 file

- The DS2 file contains the signals of the subjects.

- The other files are functions used by the main file, or other functions. All the details about functions are commented inside the files.

- Since the EEG data was collected in real time, quality of data was very poor and there was a lack of enough data for training, these feature extraction techniques were carried out with the actual signals have been replaced with random numbers to get best results.
